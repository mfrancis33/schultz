[ ] Online games
	[ ] No longer simple files: create server
	[X] Update menu (device/online)
	[ ] Add socket.io functionality
		[ ] Joining games
			- Room names and passwords
			- Player names
		[ ] Basic playable state
			- Can roll dice
			- Can score dice
			- Can win
			- Can end game
		[ ] Disconnection avoidance (because WebSocket connections randomly flicker)
			- Probably keep "secret" between client and server, if same secret then same person
			- If player doesn't respond after 1-2 minutes, kick them
		[ ] Game storage
			- Games are stored in-memory since they are temporary
			- Game room destroyed when game ends
			- Game room destroyed after XX minutes of inactivity
		[ ] Chat functionality? (probably won't do this)
[ ] Settings menu
	[X] Move settings at bottom of new game to its own menu
		[ ] Floating on top of everything else
	[ ] Accessible from home menu or in-game
	[ ] Confetti settings (maybe include fireworks as an option? laggier)
	[ ] Sound settings (suggestion)
[ ] Prompt user before reloading/leaving page if in game
[ ] Decide if 5-in-a-row stays as 1500 or 1000
	- We haven't made an official rule for it because nobody has ever gotten it, 1500 was something pulled from online

NOTE: I may end up creating a separate repository with online functionality because this was never designed for online
	- Could also play around with React or some other JS libraries to make the code less static and more reusable
