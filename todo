[ ] Online games
	[ ] No longer simple files: create server w/ database
	[ ] Update menu (device/online)
	[ ] TODO: figure out these things
		[ ] Security?
		[ ] Timeout prevention? (could use navigator.sendBeacon to send alive tick)
		[ ] What kind of DB? How much info do we store back-end?
		[ ] Decide what language to use; currently debating Python (3.10.6)
		[ ] socket.io? Or similar/custom websockets implementation?
[ ] Settings menu
	[ ] Move settings at bottom of new game to its own menu
	[ ] Accessible from home menu or in-game
	[ ] TODO: figure out these things
		[ ] Make it appear on top of everything? (similar to #particles canvas)
		[ ] Should there be new settings? Examples:
			- Confetti could have settings to tone down how much confetti is produced
			- I have a fireworks particle effect ready that could be a substitute if the user wanted
[ ] Prompt user before reloading/leaving page if in game
[ ] Decide if 5-in-a-row stays as 1500 or 1000
	- We haven't made an official rule for it because nobody has ever gotten it, 1500 was something pulled from online
