# v0.3.1
  - Fixed many bugs due to lack of testing of v0.3.0
    - Most issues were the result of not JSON-ifying something before loading it to localStorage,
      which threw errors when I tried to parse it as JSON again later
    - These issues prevented the user from playing the game

# v0.3.0
  - Added home menu
  - Added the ability to save/load games
    - This stems from a user feedback issue where players would accidentally reload pages on mobile devices by accidentally swiping up
